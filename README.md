# Assignment: AI ML Engineer Tech Evaluation Gitforce

This task involves creating a word chain game that incorporates basic NLP concepts. Here's a breakdown of the challenge:

1. Word Validation: The game uses NLTK's words corpus to validate user input.

2. Game Logic: It implements a simple turn-based game where the computer responds with a word starting with the last letter of the user's word.

3. Word Selection: The computer selects a random valid word that hasn't been used before.
